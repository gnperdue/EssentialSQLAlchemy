# Intro

## Why Use SQLAlchemy?

Abstract code away from the underlying database and its SQL particulars. It also
ensures proper sanitization and escaping to mitigate SQL-injection attacks. It
offers both "Core" and "ORM" (object-relational mapper) methods of working.

## Choosing Between Core and ORM

Core has a schema-centric view focused around tables, keys, and index structures.
The ORM focuses more on domain-driven design.

## Installing SQLAlchemy and Connecting to a Database

Basic SQLAlchemy comes with Anaconda.
